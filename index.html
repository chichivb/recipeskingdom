<!-- HTML will send to brower and brower will recive this from HTML
  and there are divs one is root and second is modal-root, both will render from browser
the reasons we have 2 of them bc there are two render 
1. is for destination for url which is using 'HashRounter' -React app 
2. is for for pop up modal 

By connecting main.jsx we can  start react  -->
